## Lotto

Lotto is a simple command-line application that simulates a lottery ticket system. Users can purchase tickets, check
them against winning numbers, and calculate their winnings.

### Implementation Requirements

| Requirement        | Description                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Code Style         | Keep functions under 10 lines to ensure they perform a single responsibility                                                |
| Control Flow       | Avoid using `else`                                                                                                          |
| Design Patterns    | Use `Enum` classes where applicable                                                                                         |
| Testing            | Implement unit tests for all logic, except for UI interactions                                                              |
| External APIs      | Use the Randoms and Console APIs provided by the `camp.nextstep.edu.missionutils package`                                   |
| Exception Handling | If the user inputs invalid data, the program must throw an `IllegalArgumentException` and re-prompt input from that step    |
| Exception Types    | Handle *only* specific exception types such as `IllegalArgumentException` or `IllegalStateException`, not generic Exception |

### Random Number Generation

To generate random values, use `Randoms.pickUniqueNumbersInRange()` from `camp.nextstep.edu.missionutils.Randoms`.

Example:

```kotlin
Randoms.pickUniqueNumbersInRange(1, 45, 6)
```

### User Input

To receive user input, use `Console.readLine()` from `camp.nextstep.edu.missionutils.Console`.

## Development Approach

Development Approach

- **Initial Approach**: Started with a C++-inspired structure, but shifted to Kotlin’s functional style and TDD for
  better modularity.
- **TDD Experience**: I initially followed Test-Driven Development (TDD) but found it challenging to maintain as the
  project progressed due to time constraints and complexity. Despite this, early TDD helped me focus on testable units.
- **Error Handling**: Focused on robust error handling using try-catch blocks for input validation and meaningful error
  messages.
- **Refactoring**: Refactored the code into modular components like Lotto, LottoIssuer, and GameResult, making it easier
  to maintain and test, though not all logic was fully covered by tests later on.

### System Flow

```
1. User Input
   │
2. InputView (parseAmountOrThrow, parseWinningNumbersOrThrow, parseBonusNumberOrThrow)
   │  └── validates input format
   │
3. Policy Validation (via PolicyExtensions)
   │  └── isAtLeastTicketPrice, hasValidSize, isInRange, doesNotOverlapWithWinningNumbers, etc.
   │      └── returns ErrorType
   │
4. Domain Processing
   │  ├── Lotto (validates and holds ticket numbers)
   │  ├── LottoIssuer (generates lottery tickets based on amount)
   │  └── LottoNumbers (generates random numbers)
   │
5. Service Orchestration (GameService)
   │  └── coordinates domain objects and view interactions
   │
6. Result Processing (GameResult)
   │  ├── LottoEvaluator (evaluates tickets against winning numbers)
   │  ├── Rank (determines prize tier based on match count)
   │  └── calculates profit rate
   │
7. Output Formatting (OutputView)
   │  └── formats results in user-friendly format
   │
8. User Display
```

### Exception Handling

The application uses try-catch blocks at two crucial points in the flow:

1. In main function
   • Used to catch any unexpected errors that might arise during the execution of the lottery game, ensuring the
   application does not crash unexpectedly.
2. In repeatUntilValid function
   • Handles validation errors and provides users with clear error messages, allowing them to correct input and retry
   without restarting the application.

These two try-catch blocks ensure that errors are caught at the appropriate layers (controller and UI validation) and
that the user experience is smooth with continuous retries on invalid input.
